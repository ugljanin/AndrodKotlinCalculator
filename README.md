# Calculator

## First task

Create a calculator app in Kotlin that includes two EditText fields for inputting numbers and four buttons for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Below the buttons, display the result in the format 'Result: NUMBER', where 'NUMBER' is the calculated value based on the user's input. Create it using responsive layout.
